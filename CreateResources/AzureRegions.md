Azure regions are identified by specific strings, and these strings represent geographical locations where Azure resources are deployed. The valid Azure region strings are standardized and consist of a combination of letters and numbers. Here are some examples of valid Azure region strings:

- East US
- West US
- North Central US
- South Central US
- West Central US
- East US 2
- West US 2
- West US 3
- Canada Central
- Canada East
- Central India
- South India
- West India
- UK South
- UK West
- North Europe
- West Europe
- East Asia
- Southeast Asia
- Japan East
- Japan West
- Australia East
- Australia Southeast
- Brazil South

These are just a few examples, and Azure continues to expand its presence globally, so new regions may be added over time. It's always a good idea to check the [official Azure documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) for the most up-to-date list of Azure regions and their respective strings.

When working with Azure ARM templates or Azure CLI commands that require a region parameter, you can use any of these valid Azure region strings based on your geographical preferences or specific requirements.
